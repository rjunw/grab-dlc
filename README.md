# Grab Steam DLC IDs

Parse Steam HTML to get DLC appid's

## Instructions
Run `python parser.py` and enter game id!

## Example

## TODO:
* Refactor some class methods
* Scour through `<steam_dir>` and use the game id's there
* Build a GUI (or TUI?)
* Redirect formatted outputs to files
* Generalize this when it inevitably breaks from steam website changes
